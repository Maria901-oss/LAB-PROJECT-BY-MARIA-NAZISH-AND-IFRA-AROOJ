Ensure that the required libraries and header files are included in our project.As we had used  codeblocks WIN32GUI for our project it has many already builtin libraries and one of then is window library which is used for creating GUI template. THE libraries in our project are:
Comctl32.lib,user32.lib, Gdi32.lib, kernel32.lib,psapi.lib
